📘 My First ML Model
This project demonstrates the basic workflow of building, training, and evaluating machine learning regression models using Python's scikit-learn. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format and is ideal for beginners looking to understand supervised learning with regression techniques.

📂 File Structure
My_First_ML_Model.ipynb: The main notebook containing code for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

🛠️ Features
Uses train_test_split to divide data

Trains a Linear Regression model

Trains a Random Forest Regressor

Evaluates model performance using:

R² Score

Optional: MAE, RMSE (if added later)

🧰 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

scikit-learn (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, train_test_split, r2_score)

🚀 Getting Started
Clone or download the repository

Open the notebook My_First_ML_Model.ipynb in Jupyter

Run the cells to:

Preprocess the data

Train the models

Evaluate and compare results
